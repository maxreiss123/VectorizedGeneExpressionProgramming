# VectorizedGeneExpressionProgramming
This is a symbolic regression algorithm whereby Gene Expression Programming is a role model.
(the operators changed - for experimental reasons)

# Todo 
- Inner approximation of the constants with perturbation and the application of the gene fusion operator
- Vectorization cost evaluation
- Vectorization genetic operators
- Random application of genetic operators


#Remarks
Please add some comments
