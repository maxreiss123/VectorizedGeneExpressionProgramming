# VectorizedGeneExpressionProgramming
- This is a symbolic regression algorithm with Gene Expression Programming as a role model. (the operators changed - for experimental reasons)

# Todo 
- Inner approximation of the constants with perturbation and the application of the gene fusion operator
- Vectorization cost evaluation
- Vectorization genetic operators
- Random application of genetic operators
- Conversion to Julia - (Needs to be tested/debugged)
- Implementing of learnable weights for the genetic operators
- Implementation of an attention-based mutation operator

#Remarks
- Please add some comments
