# VectorizedGeneExpressionProgramming
- This is a symbolic regression algorithm whereby Gene Expression Programming is a role model. (the operators changed - for experimental reasons)

# Todo 
- Inner approximation of the constants with perturbation and the application of the gene fusion operator
- Vectorization cost evaluation
- Vectorization genetic operators
- Random application of genetic operators
- Conversion to Julia - (Needs to be tested)

#Remarks
- Time comparison between Julia and Python: Julia needs roughly 14s, while python needs 74s
- Please add some comments
